# stakx.Moq (abandoned)

This is an abandoned fork of [MoqÂ®](https://github.com/moq/moq), a popular and friendly mocking library for .NET.

I have decided to stop work on this project since I received a copyright / trademark infringement claim by the original project owner and was forced to take down the published NuGet package. While I _could_ rename this project and re-upload it under a different name, that would perhaps not make much sense for a small, mostly unused fork with respect to its discoverability. So I consider my work on this project concluded. It was good while it lasted!
